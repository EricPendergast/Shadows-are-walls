Lights
    - Single light
        ✓- Frustrum clipping
        ✓- mesh drawing
        ✓- Fix the bug where theres an error every time the number of vertices changes
    - Shadow intersections with multiple lights
        ✓- Make a Shadow class, which is created whenever an opaque line segment enters the view of a light
        ~- Make a centralized class to calculate shadow intersections
        - Make opaque objects only generate one shadow each
        ✓- Make it so shadow edges can be created by anything, not just opaque objects
    - Update ShadowEdge
        ✓- Make Math.MinimalUnion retain the correspondence between trimmedShadows and shadowsIn
        - Make it so shadow edges are only created if they survive trimming
            - Pass in left and right edges
    ✓- Make shadows (kind of) render with pure gizmos
    - Find a way to draw the triangles with borders, because in some cases there is a 1 pixel gap between them
    - Collision boxes
    - Moving collision boxes
